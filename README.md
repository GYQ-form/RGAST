## Usage

RGAST is a deep learning framework designed to infer multi-scale cell-cell communication (CCC) networks de novo from spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. RGAST integrates spatial proximity and transcriptional profiles using a relational graph attention mechanism. This approach allows RGAST to dynamically learn context-specific signaling patterns and reconstruct CCC networks without prior knowledge of ligand-receptor pairs, effectively capturing both local and global communication patterns. Besides, RGAST is also a versatile tool for many downstream ST analysis:

- spatial domain identification
- spatially variable gene (SVG) detection
- cell trajectory inference
- reveal intricate 3D spatial patterns across multiple sections of ST data
